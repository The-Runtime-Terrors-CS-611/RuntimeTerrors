        Chris Soard, General Contractor
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
Chris is a mid-30s general contractor. He was born and raised in Indianapolis, and his parents are both accountants.  Although he got his undergraduate degree in Architectural Design from the University of Cincinnati, the pandemic uprooted his post-grad plans.  He moved back to Indy to be closer to his family and got a job with a local remodeling company.  In his free time, Chris relaxes mainly by playing video games at home.  His favorite genre is role playing games where your in-game decisions shape the world and the story.  He usually plays on console.  <br><br>
He is interested in Forged in Fire for many reasons.  For one, he is very interested in how the playable character’s choices and actions change the character themselves.  Since he is an avid gamer, he also hopes there are other classic video game features such as an inventory system where you can use items to further quests and dialogue, or a time constraint to give a sense of urgency to save the village.  His main concern is that it is too long and drags on.  While the story should be fulfilling and come to a natural conclusion, any longer than 5ish hours and he feels he would rather just read a book.
