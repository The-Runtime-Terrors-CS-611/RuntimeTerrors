        Julia Finn, Middle School Teacher
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
Julia, age 23, is a 5th grade teacher in Aurora, Colorado, just outside of Denver. She teaches 5th grade, all subjects. She was born in Sacramento, California, where her father teaches Anatomy and Kinesiology at a community college, and her mother teaches English as a second language to adults. She earned her degree in Elementary Education from Boise State University and has been teaching for the past two years. <br><br>
Julia’s experience teaching young children has sparked her creativity and imagination and has encouraged her to explore ways she can pursue that creativity through technology, while encouraging her students to do the same. She believes that technology can support both her and her students in their learning and growth. She is interested in using Forged in Fire to inspire her students’ inventiveness and story telling abilities. <br><br>
After school, Julia also enjoys relaxing with a nice mystery or fantasy book. Outside of using Forged in Fire as a teaching tool, she is interested in playing it in her downtime as a way to wind down after a long day at work. She feels that a choose your own adventure game could read as an interactive book, which she would love to explore.
