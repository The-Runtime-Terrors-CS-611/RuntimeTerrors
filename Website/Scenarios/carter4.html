        Alex Carter Scenario #4
    </h2>

    <h2>Lunch Break Progress with Checkpoints</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
Alex has a 30-minute lunch break during training school and wants to make meaningful progress in the story without losing his place. He opens the game on his phone, loads his most recent checkpoint, and quickly re-orients himself to the current branch.
      <br><br>
As Alex plays, he reaches a decision that affects how an NPC feels about him. He chooses an option that improves the relationship but costs him resources, and the game reflects the consequence immediately. A few scenes later, another decision builds on that earlier choice and changes the tone of an encounter, reinforcing that the story is responding to what he has done.
      <br><br>
The main problem Alex runs into with many CYOA games is that short sessions are wasted if he cannot save reliably and resume quickly. To reach his objective, he needs a clear checkpoint system, a quick way to continue where he left off, and a summary or context cue so he can return after a break without rereading large sections. The preferred approach is a save/load system with checkpoints at natural story beats and a “continue” option that returns him to the most recent stable point.
