        Kofi Asirifi Scenario #2
    </h2>

    <h2>The Saturday Morning "Kid-Zone" Sprint</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
    While his wife is at the grocery store, Kofi tries to play a quick chapter on his tablet while the kids are occupied with a cartoon. Every few minutes, he’s interrupted to open a snack or settle a toy dispute. When he returns to the screen, he’s in the middle of a complex crafting sequence where his previous choices determine the durability of a legendary blade. Because the game lacks a reflection diary or summary tool to remind him of the materials he gathered twenty minutes ago, he feels mentally scattered. The "meaningful choices" start to feel like a memory test he's failing, and the cognitive load of jumping between fatherhood and high-fantasy forging becomes so exhausting that he closes the app without finishing the level.
