        Kofi Asirifi Scenario #4
    </h2>

    <h2>The "Logic-Gate" Lockout</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
It’s midnight in Atlanta. Kofi Sirifi has just spent the last six hours untangling a massive ransomware threat for a high-profile client. His brain is still vibrating in "security specialist" mode—scanning for vulnerabilities, mapping dependencies, and calculating risk. As the rest of the house sleeps, he fires up Forged in Fire, looking for a tactical outlet where his analytical skills actually matter. He enters a high-stakes negotiation with a rogue faction leader. The game presents a binary choice: "Pay the Bribe" or "Initiate a Raid."
<br><br>
Kofi pauses, his professional instincts kicking in. He wants to see a Detailed Relationship Log to calculate the specific "Security Impact" on his home base if he chooses the raid, but the UI is silent. He looks for a way to use his character’s "Tech-Logic" Skills—perhaps a hacking or strategy check—to find a third option that preserves his resources, but the game forces a simplistic emotional response instead.
<br><br>
Worse, because he’s been away on a busy on-site job for three days, he’s lost the thread of the plot. Without a Localized Story Summary, he can't remember which faction leader he’s even talking to. He craves a Branch Review tool to see the logic path of his previous decisions—to understand exactly how his last "firewall" choice in the story led to this specific political bottleneck.
<br><br>
Feeling like a specialist forced to use blunt tools, he makes a rushed, uninformed decision. The choice triggers a "Dark Turn" that collapses his carefully managed political alliances. Instead of the satisfying "win" his brain needs to decompress, Kofi is left staring at a screen of chaotic consequences he can’t trace back to logic, leaving him more wired and frustrated than when he started.
