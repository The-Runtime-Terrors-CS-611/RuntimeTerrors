        Chris Soard Scenario #2
    </h2>

    <h2>Use the World to Your Advantage</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      One of Chris’s favorite genres of video games is survival.  He also really likes games like Forged in Fire where you shape the story yourself, yet he has one main gripe with the choose-your-own-adventure genre.  Many of them rely too heavily upon dialogue.  While he enjoys well-written dialogue, there is much more to a good game than that.   
      <br><br>
      The basic plot of Forged in Fire lends itself well to falling into the survival genre.  In addition to making dialogue choices, and choosing what paths to follow etc., Chris enjoys interacting with the environment around him.  The character starts out with a pack of rabbit meat from a successful hunt, but who knows how long that will last?  While in the village at the beginning, he has a chance to rush into a burning home to grab a large axe.  This axe in his inventory greatly comes in handy later in the story, as he uses it to fit off a small band of bandits.  He continues to interact with the world and pick up every item the game allows.  While some are a red herring, some special items unlock unique dialogue and storylines with certain NPCs.  To add some constraints, the inventory sack has a weight limit so Chris has to decide what he can carry and what he must leave.  This feature allows Chris to play the game over many times, using different items to write different stories each time.
