        Technological Choices Narrative
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
    Forged In Fire will use a NoSQL database, and a multitenant database system.  It is a web application and there is not much that will be contained in the database: inventory, relationship status, save files etc.  There is not a need for each user to have their own dedicated database.  The delivery platform we will develop for is the desktop browser.  The goal for the game is to feel old school and being browser-based will achieve this perfectly. We will use a cloud server for ease of use, low initial costs, ease of scalability, etc. The main open-source tool we will use is the Bootstrap framework for streamlining our web application’s CSS styling.  Other dev tools we will use include each of us using our preferred IDE, git for version control, GitHub for collaboration, docker for containerization, Jest for testing, Jira for project management, discord for communication and any others we might need along the way.
