    <h2>
      Interview Info
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Date: 1/28/2026</li>
    <li>Interviewer: Ben Waddell</li>
    <li>Duration: 45 Minutes</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

   <h2>
      Top Takeaways
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Strong use case is deployed / on ship: they want something that works offline and fits short sessions.</li>
    <li>They expect meaningful consequences where choices clearly lock you out of options, change outcomes, or create tradeoffs (hurt/slow you down, can’t do X anymore).</li>
    <li>They want more than a “maze to 2–3 endings”; choices should feel important and produce real variety.</li>
    <li>They haven’t played CYOA before, but the concept appeals because it feels unique and they like the thrill of the unknown and choices affecting outcomes.</li>
    <li>Aesthetically, they’re open to art and mentioned a preference for pixelated style if you include visuals.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

   <h2>
      Top Concerns/Turn-offs
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Bad grammar / writing quality is an immediate turn-off.</li>
    <li>Instant death early on, and feeling railroaded by the story or “fake choices.”</li>
    <li>They don’t want current-issues / political commentary baked into the story.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

   <h2>
      Top Desired Features
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Save/Load (especially important for mobile + interruptions and deployment)</li>
    <li>Downloadable/offline support (explicitly needed to play on the ship)</li>
    <li>More storylines / branching variety (avoid only 2–3 endings)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Notable Quote (Optional)</h2>
  <p class="paragraph_design">“A lot of those stories… are just like a maze to end up at one of [two or three endings]. That makes the choices feel unimportant.”</p>
