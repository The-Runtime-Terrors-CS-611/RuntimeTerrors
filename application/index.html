  FORGED IN FIRE
</h1>
<div class="all">
 <div id="intro">
<p>The snow crunches beneath your feet. The sting of winter's first chill bites at your cheeks. The coming months will be difficult, and you've been tasked to help fill your village's stores. You're not a hunter by trade but if every single member of the village doesn't help to prepare for the harsh winters of Glacerra, no one would survive. If this winter was to be anything like the last, you still may lose a few.</p>
<p>You've been in the woods for a couple of hours already and have seen scarcely more than birds and squirrels. Enough squirrels could make a fine stew, but something draws you onward. Something about today is different. The air tastes strange. Something about the way the wind blows through the barren branches of the trees reverberates in your chest. There's a soft pull from deep inside you. It tells you destiny is at work.</p>
<p>And just then, like answering a knock at the door, your prey appears. Stepping out from behind a tree about 50 feet from you is an incredibly large buck. The sharp points of his antlers almost seem to glow golden in the early morning light. He stands several hands taller than you, even with his head lowered. At this distance, you're unsure how you haven't spooked him already. Maybe the snow has dampened the sound of your footsteps, but you know that you have only a moment to ponder what to do before he recognizes your presence.</p>

 <div hidden id="rangerStart" class="level1">
<p>You do it just like your brother taught you.  Growing up in Glacerra, there was little time for any activity not directly related to survival.  The tiny bit of “fun” you had, if you can call it that, was learning the art of bow-hunting from Flynn.  He gamified it as much as he could, but you knew the truth.  The outcome of your fun little hunting challenge decided if your family got to eat that night.  You were never able to beat Flynn.  He was a natural at everything he did; hunting, fishing, building fires, cooking, you name it – Flynn could do it, and he could do it well.  </p>
<p>That’s why, when the hunting party returned that fateful day, you refused to believe it.  They told you one of the newer party members was attacked by a bear and your brother jumped in to save them.  The poor kid would have been long gone without Flynn’s sacrifice.  The bear did so much damage so quickly, they couldn’t find any recognizable part of him to bring back to the village.  You were so young, it took over a year to truly realize what had happened.  Sometimes, it still feels like he might come walking through the door, deer in hand and that goofy smile on his face…</p>
<p>You were so lost in thought, you didn’t realize the buck laid eyes on you.  Shit, you can’t come home emptyhanded again.  Before the buck has time to even blink, you nock an arrow.  Your wondering mind has cost you, and the beast starts to run out of your clear shot.</p>

</select>
</div>
<div hidden id="rangerA"class="level2">
    <p>With a motion that you have been practicing essentially since birth, you let an arrow fly straight at its heart.  You hear the sound of the arrow finding purchase, quickly followed by the sound of the buck hitting the ground.  Flynn would be proud, but there’s no time to dwell on that.  Getting a buck this large back to the village will prove to be almost as difficult as killing it.  With a long and arduous journey ahead, you head out into the blizzard, bearing good news for the village.  </p>
</div>
<div hidden id="rangerB"class="level2">
    <p>The buck got the jump on you, so you settle for the easier shot.  Your arrow flies straight for its gut.  Not a clean hit, but a hit none the less.  At that moment, your bones start to shiver.  Something isn’t right.  You look to see where the buck is headed.  A gut shot isn’t immediately fatal, but it should probably be trying to run away, leaving a trail of blood.  What you see instead you will never forget as long as you live.  The buck, arrow lodged deep in its gut, is staring you dead in the eyes.  For a moment, you hear a word in your head, as if the buck is telling you something.  No, warning you. </p>
    <p>"RUN"</p>
    <p>Before you can even think, you start sprinting back to the village.  Your memory of this day becomes foggy soon after, but one think you will never forget: your fear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="barbarianAll">
 <div hidden id="barbarianStart"class="level1">
<p>With a near animal speed, you rush the buck before it even senses your presense.  Despite its size, your axe fells him quite quickly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the woods go silent. Three mountain-dwellers, clad in human bone and cured hide, emerge from the mist. These are the Pale-Eaters, titans of the high peaks, towering over you with sharpened teeth and hunger in their eyes. They’ve tracked you well. Your heart thunders—not with fear, but with the raw bloodlust of the cornered... you charge forward, drawing an axe.</p>
<p>You don't fight for survival; you fight for the honor of the slaughter. Letting out a guttural roar that shatters the winter silence, you spring from the dense treeline. The lead cannibal's head snaps up, eyes wide with the recognition of a fellow predator. You feel the familiar weight of your axe as it clears its leather loop. The cannibal doesn’t flee. He raises a jagged blade of obsidian and digs his heels into the permafrost. You welcome the sight. If these monsters take your life, you will die a warrior’s death in the red snow. If you take theirs, you feast on the glory of the mountain. You leap into the air, aiming a heavy overhead strike at the leader’s throat. A jagged bone knife grazes your shoulder. The pain is sharp—a beautiful, stinging gift that focuses your mind. The brute staggers, his breath coming in ragged, frozen clouds. He looks at you with a primal hatred that demands respect. You are both exhausted, two forces of nature colliding in a world that wants you both dead. One final effort will decide who remains to see the spring.</p>

</div>
<div hidden id="barbarianA"class="level2">
    <p>The Pale-Eater lunges, but you catch his wrist in a grip of iron. You ignore the blood slicking your skin; the shattered bone in your shoulder is just fuel for the fire in your gut. With a roar that echoes off the peaks Glacerra, you heave the giant off his feet. You don't need a clever plan, you have the raw, unyielding power of a man who has looked at death and laughed. You drive your forehead into his face with a sickening crunch, then bury your axe into his chest with enough force to split the frozen ground beneath him. Now you have to consume the heart of your fallen foe to claim his mountain-strength for yourself, the Barbarian.</p>
</div>
<div hidden id="barbarianB"class="level2">
<p>You muster all of your strenght, but unfortunately the Pale-Eater is both faster and stronger.  You die a gruesome, unceremonious death.</p>
<p>THE END</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="rogueAll">
 <div hidden id="rogueStart"class="level1">
<p>In an attempt to get his attention without frightening him off, you pick up a small stick, and toss it about 15 feet to your left. It lands in the snow with a soft thud. The sound is almost imperceptible to the human ear, but the buck immediately jerks his attention to the location of the noise. Swiftly, you slip behind a large pine tree, gaining yourself a nearly perfect position to make your next move. Silently, you draw your spear, and without wasting another moment, hurl it directly into the bucks neck. He dies instantly, a painless death, and immediately drops to the ground. You approach the animal slowly, ensuring that he is truly gone, before withdrawing your spear and wiping it clean in the snow. You deliberately take a deep breath in, then out, taking a moment of gratitude to acknowledge what this buck will do for you and your village in these trying times. </p>
<p>The buck is much larger than anything you had anticipated killing, and you come to the understanding that you will not be able to drag this buck all the way back to camp on your own easily. If you attempt to do it on your own, you risk coming upon nightfall, which leaves you in danger of unknown predators or freezing to death. However, if you go back to the village for help, you risk another animal finding the buck and eating their fill before you get the chance to bring it back to your village. You realize that getting the buck back to your village in a timely manner could be the difference between life and death for some of your people, so you don’t have any more time to waste.</p>

</select>
</div>
<div hidden id="rogueA"class="level2">
    <p>You take out your rope from your pack, and efficiently tie a tight knot around the bucks’ antlers, just the way you’ve practiced. You hoist the rope over your shoulder, tying the excess in a loop around your waist to help you gain leverage. After adjusting your feet to obtain better traction, you take your first step south towards your village.</p>
</div>
<div hidden id="rogueB"class="level2">
    <p>In hopes of suppressing the strong animal scent, you use your gloved hands to scoop snow over the buck, covering his body as well as you can. You reach up above your head to a barren tree, and tear off one of the branches, marking the spot where the elk is buried by sticking the broken branch in the snow near his head. You take a hurried look around, ensuring that you will be able to recognize the location when you return, and head south, back toward your village.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="mageAll">
 <div hidden id="mageStart"class="level1">
    <p>You feel your hand begin to move before you even think to do it.</p>
<p>Your fingers unfurl, palm toward the buck, and the cold air between you seems to tighten like a drawn string. Something old stirs in your bones, something you’ve never had a name for. The world goes strangely quiet, as if the forest itself is holding its breath. Even the wind through the bare branches softens, turning from a whistle into a hush.</p>
<p>The buck doesn’t bolt. It doesn’t even flinch.</p>
<p>Its antlers catch the morning light and the gold in them isn’t just a trick of the sun. The glow deepens, pulsing once… twice… like a heartbeat you can see. A thin ribbon of frost snakes across the snow toward it, tracing a path you didn’t ask for but somehow understand. Your breath fogs in front of your face, and in that fog you swear you see shapes, symbols, half-formed and hungry to become real.</p>
<p>Then the buck lifts its head, finally meeting your eyes.</p>
<p>For a moment, you feel recognized.</p>
<p>Not hunted. Not threatened. Chosen.</p>
<p>Your hand trembles, not from the cold, but from the weight of what you could do next.</p>

    <option value="mage1">Release what’s building inside you and strike the buck with raw force.</option>
    <option value="mage2">Hold the spell back and reach for something gentler, trying to bind or calm it instead.</option>
</select>
</div>
<div hidden id="mageA"class="level2">
<p>The power surges like a fever breaking. You don’t shape it so much as let go, and the world happily fills in the rest.</p>
<p>Light cracks from your palm in a sharp, beautiful line, but it’s too bright, too fast. The snow flashes white. The buck’s golden antlers flare in response, like a torch catching oil. For one glorious heartbeat you think you’ve done it. You think you’ve tapped something meant for legends.</p>
<p>Then the magic rebounds.</p>
<p>It doesn’t bounce off the buck like stone. It turns, like it was always meant to come home.</p>
<p>You have just enough time to think, very clearly, I should have practiced more than “hand up, hope for the best.”</p>
<p>The blast slams into your chest with the enthusiasm of a tavern brawler meeting a free chair. You lift off your feet, drift backward in a graceful arc, and land in a snowbank so deep it feels like the earth politely swallowing you.</p>
<p>Everything goes dark.</p>
<p>Somewhere above, a squirrel chitters as if laughing.</p>
<p>Oops. You died.</p>
<p>END</p>
</div>
<div hidden id="mageB"class="level2">
<p>You don’t throw the spell. You cup it, like carrying a coal in your hands without letting it burn the world down.</p>
<p>Your fingers curl slightly, and the symbols in your breath-fog tighten into a thin ring of pale light. It slides over the snow, quiet as a whisper, and settles around the buck’s legs—not to trap, but to anchor. The buck shifts, testing it, and you feel the spell strain like a rope under weight. You swallow hard and soften your grip, easing the magic into something steadier.</p>
<p>The buck exhales. A long, slow plume of white.</p>
<p>Its posture changes. Not relaxed exactly, but… listening.</p>
<p>A strange warmth blooms behind your ribs, the kind you feel when you finally remember a word you’ve been missing your whole life. The golden glow in the antlers dims, becoming less like fire and more like candlelight. The buck steps forward once, then twice, stopping just close enough that you can see the frost clinging to its lashes.</p>
<p>You should be terrified. Instead, you feel a quiet certainty settle over you.</p>
<p>You don’t take the shot.</p>
<p>You take a breath, lower your hand, and the ring of light dissolves into the snow like it was never there. The buck turns, unhurried, and walks deeper into the trees, pausing once to glance back as if to make sure you’re following the right idea, even if you don’t understand it yet.</p>
<p>When it disappears, you realize your cheeks aren’t stinging anymore.</p>
<p>You stand in the stillness, heart hammering, hands shaking, and you know two things:</p>
<p>Winter is coming.</p>
<p>And so is something else.</p>
<p>You head back toward [Place Name] with empty hands… and a full, unsettling sense that you’ve just been invited into a story much bigger than hunger.</p>
