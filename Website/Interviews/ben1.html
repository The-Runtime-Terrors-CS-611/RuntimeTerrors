    <h2>
      Interview Info
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Date: 1/28/2026</li>
    <li>Interviewer: Ben Waddell</li>
    <li>Duration: 45 Minutes</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

   <h2>
      Top Takeaways
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>The biggest “hook” for them is an immersive, alive world where relationships change the story and affect future outcomes.</li>
    <li>They want meaningful choices with real consequences, including compound/conditional outcomes (specific combinations of earlier decisions unlock different paths later).</li>
    <li>They’re into low-fantasy, grounded, serious tone, but not “save the world” epic. </li>
    <li>They like light systems layered onto narrative: resource tradeoffs (rations now vs buffs later) and tactical/task direction choices (assign positions in an encounter).</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

   <h2>
      Top Concerns/Turn-offs
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>False choice / linearity: If choices don’t matter and it feels like a single track, they’ll bounce.</li>
    <li>No save/checkpoint: If death or a branch ending forces restarting from the beginning, that’s a major turn-off.</li>
    <li>They don’t want the game to lean into social/political commentary; specifically mentioned avoiding focus on sexuality/gender identity topics.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

   <h2>
      Top Desired Features
    </h2>

    <div class="center-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Save/Load with checkpoints (not on every screen, but reliable enough to avoid full restarts)</li>
    <li>Relationship tracking / reputation scale that visibly shifts based on choices</li>
    <li>More branching / replay value (more story branches; later updates could add multiclassing / deeper character customization)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Notable Quote (Optional)</h2>
  <p class="paragraph_design">“I like compounding decisions that a required to be made to acess a certain branch. As an example: I’m where I am in the story because I made choice A at story point 2 and choice C at story point 5.”</p>
