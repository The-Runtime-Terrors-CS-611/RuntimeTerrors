        Chris Soard Scenario #3
    </h2>

    <h2>The Clock is Ticking!</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      As a veteran gamer, Chris appreciates more advanced features in games to keep him locked in to the gameplay.  While the nature of Forged in Fire being a text-based game doesn’t lend itself to a lot of fancy features such as 3D art, advanced combat, or physics engines, there are still ways to keep Chris engaged.  One such way is to have time constraints in the game.        
      <br><br>
      At one point in the game, the main character needs to try to deceive some guards to infiltrate a camp.  This is a dire situation that could have massive implications later in the story.  To simulate the intensity and urgency of the situation, Chris is given different dialogue choices with a 15-second timer.  If he doesn’t choose before the timer runs out, the character is silent, arousing suspicion from the guard.  That would potentially lead to imprisonment, or worse.  This means that in life-or-death situations in the game, the timer will help Chris feel the sense of urgency the character would feel, heightening the immersion within the game.      
      <br><br>
      Another feature Chris appreciates is the greater time constraint upon the game.  With the state of the kidnapped villagers remaining unknown and a large blizzard on the horizon, the safety of the villagers is far from guaranteed.  Surely taking too much time would inevitably lead to their demise.  That is why Chris is given an overarching time constraint of X in-game days to solve the mystery and find the villagers.  He really likes how that adds to the difficulty of the game, and how it gives each decision a lot of weight.  Each wrong choice could lead one second closer to the villagers’ doom.
