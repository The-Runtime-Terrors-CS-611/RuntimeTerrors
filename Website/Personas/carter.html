        Alex Carter, a deployed mobile CYOA player
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Alex is in his mid-to-late 20s and serves in the U.S. Navy. His schedule is structured and busy, and most of his free time comes in short windows like lunch breaks, evenings, or downtime while deployed. He plays games a few times a week and gravitates toward fantasy experiences that feel immersive and “alive,” especially when he can influence relationships with other characters and see those relationships reshape the story.
      <br><br>
    Alex is comfortable with technology and plays mainly on his phone because it is always available, but he will also game on PC when he has the time. He enjoys D&D and strategy-leaning games, so he appreciates systems that add light structure to the narrative, like resource tradeoffs or choices that affect future encounters. For Alex, choices only feel meaningful when they have consequences that compound over time, and he is quick to lose interest if the story feels railroaded or if the writing quality breaks immersion.
    <br><br>
    Alex is interested in this game because it fits his life: a story he can play in short sessions, replay to explore different branches, and reliably continue without having to restart from the beginning. He wants a downloadable/offline-friendly experience with save/load checkpoints, visible relationship tracking, and enough branching variety that “replaying” actually feels like discovering new content rather than navigating a maze to the same two endings.
