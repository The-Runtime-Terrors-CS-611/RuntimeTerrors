  <p class="paragraph">Rudon was born and raised on the beautiful island Nassau, which is in the Bahamas. 
    He is a former student on the University of Louisville, where he earned his Bachelors in Health and Human Performance 
    (with hopes of Physical Therapy). He later learned that it takes a whole lot to get there. He changed focus and obtained 
    a MS in Human Resources Management, minoring in Training and Development. A year after obtaining his first masters degree, 
    he enlisted in to the army where he became a Human Resources Manager in the Army until this present day. 
    He fell in love with the idea of fusing both aspects and creating something special and useful for society.
    He is a War and Sci-Fi buff. Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit are his favourite movie Trilogies, so fantasy movies 
    and shows are the greatest in his eyes. </p>
