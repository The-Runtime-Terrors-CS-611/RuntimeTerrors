        Julia Finn Scenario #2
    </h2>

    <h2>Using the Game to Teach Narrative Story Arcs</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
Julia Finn is a 5th grade teacher in Aurora, Colorado. Today, she is teaching her students about narrative writing and wants to introduce narrative story arcs. She recently discovered a choose your own adventure game called Forged in Fire, and wants to try to use this game as an engaging way to talk about the progression of narratives. 
      <br><br>
Julia printed out some worksheets of narrative story arcs with blank spaces for the children to fill in for each part of the arc- exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. The students will play the game, making choices as they go, and fill in the worksheet based on the story that they help create. Julia assigns them the game and worksheet as homework. Once they have completed their homework, she assigns them to random groups of three, and instructs them to share their work. 
      <br><br>
While walking around the room, she realizes that many of the story arcs are almost exactly the same. She is disappointed because she assumed that there would be quite a few fairly different stories, due the the CYOA aspect of the game, but she discovers that the choices that the students were allowed to make during the game didn’t actually impact the overall storyline very much. This defeats the purpose of her students sharing different examples of narrative story arcs.
