    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
    <strong>As a teacher using a CYOA game to teach narrative structure, I want player choices to significantly alter the story’s plot and outcome, so students can experience and compare genuinely different narrative arcs. </strong><br><br>
<strong>As a teacher assigning the game as homework, I want multiple distinct story paths that map to different climaxes and resolutions, so student work reflects diverse interpretations of the same narrative framework.</strong><br><br>
<strong>As a player who plays in short sessions after work, I want the game to automatically save my progress after every meaningful choice, so I can resume exactly where I left off without losing progress.</strong><br><br>
<strong>As a player returning to the game after a break, I want the game to reopen at my most recent decision point, so I can smoothly continue the story instead of replaying large sections.</strong><br><br>
<strong>As a strategic thinker, I want branch endings to provide a "post-mortem" summary explaining which specific security or relationship failures led to my outcome.</strong><br><br>
<strong>As a deployed mobile CYOA player, I want a “Return to last branch point” option when a branch ends so that I can explore other choices without restarting the entire story.</strong><br><br>
As a deployed mobile CYOA player, I want the game to be fully playable offline so that I can play without reliable internet access.<br><br>
As a deployed mobile CYOA player, I want a relationship tracker for key characters so that I can see how my choices are affecting my standing with them.<br><br>
As a player who values immersion over challenge, I want a way to undo or revise a recent choice, so an unclear or accidental decision doesn’t derail the story into a direction I didn’t intend.<br><br>
As a deployed mobile CYOA player, I want my resources (like rations or supplies) to be tracked persistently so that survival choices have lasting consequences.<br><br>
As an avid gamer, I need a logbook that keeps track of any world-building lore that I have learned so I can remember key information when making decisions later in the game.<br><br>
As a busy father of four, I want a “Previously On” recap every time I resume play so I can instantly regain my immersion during a five-minute bathroom break.
As an avid gamer, I want certain important decisions to have a timer on them to simulate urgency while playing the game.

  <h2>Constraints</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Developing this prototype within the given time constraint of the class moves some features to stretch that would under other circumstances be included in the minimum-viable product; i.e. offline playability, relationship tracking, etc.</p>
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Based on Kofi’s, Julia’s, Alex’s, and Chris’s scenarios.</p>
