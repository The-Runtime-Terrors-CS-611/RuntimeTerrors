        Kofi Asirifi Scenario #1
    </h2>

    <h2>The Midnight "Shift" Recovery</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
    It’s 1:00 AM. Kofi has just closed his laptop after a grueling six-hour stretch of troubleshooting a production server outage. The house is finally silent—his wife and four kids are asleep—and he needs to shift his brain from "logic mode" to "story mode" before he can rest. He opens Forged in Fire and is met with several dense screens of political intrigue. Just as he finishes the last paragraph, the game snaps to a dialogue choice: "Betray the King" or "Stay Loyal." With no way to pause or reread recent sections and no log to check who "the King" actually is in this context, he feels panicked rather than immersed. He ends up making a rushed choice he doesn't understand, causing the story to take a dark turn that ruins his mood right before sleep.
