  FORGED IN FIRE
</h1>
<div class="all">
 <div id="intro">
<p>The snow crunches beneath your feet. The sting of winter's first chill bites at your cheeks. The coming months will be difficult, and you've been tasked to help fill your village's stores. You're not a hunter by trade but if every single member of the village doesn't help to prepare for the harsh winters of [Place Name], no one would survive. If this winter was to be anything like the last, you still may lose a few.</p>
<p>You've been in the woods for a couple of hours already and have seen scarcely more than birds and squirrels. Enough squirrels could make a fine stew, but something draws you onward. Something about today is different. The air tastes strange. Something about the way the wind blows through the barren branches of the trees reverberates in your chest. There's a soft pull from deep inside you. It tells you destiny is at work.</p>
<p>And just then, like answering a knock at the door, your prey appears. Stepping out from behind a tree about 50 feet from you is an incredibly large buck. The sharp points of his antlers almost seem to glow golden in the early morning light. He stands several hands taller than you, even with his head lowered. At this distance, you're unsure how you haven't spooked him already. Maybe the snow has dampened the sound of your footsteps, but you know that you have only a moment to ponder what to do before he recognizes your presence.</p>
