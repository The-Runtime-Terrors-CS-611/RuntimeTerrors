        Kofi Asirifi, Cyber Security Manager and Dad of Four
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Kofi is in his late 30s and works in Cybersecurity in Atlanta. His life is a high-stakes balancing act: by day, he’s monitoring network threats and managing logs; by evening, he’s managing the high-energy chaos of four young boys. Because his home life is non-stop, he treats his quiet downtime at the office as a sanctuary where he can catch up on socials and sink into mobile games.<br><br>
Kofi is tech-savvy and demands a polished, efficient user experience. He primarily plays on his phone because it’s discreet and fits into the 15-to-30-minute windows he carves out between work tasks or after the kids are in bed. He gravitates toward dark fantasy with a gritty, atmospheric vibe that serves as a total escape from the clinical nature of his job. For Kofi, "meaningful choice" isn't just a marketing buzzword; he wants to see the compounding consequences of his actions, where a moral "gray area" decision in the first act creates a massive ripple effect in the third.<br><br>
Kofi is interested in this game because it respects his limited time while satisfying his craving for a deep narrative. He isn't looking for a "railroaded" experience; he wants a game that offers multiple save slots so he can experiment with different "what if" scenarios without losing his progress. He values high-quality art and audio that build immersion quickly, and he is quick to drop a game if the UI is clunky or the choices feel like "false agency." For him, the ideal game is a mobile-optimized, branching epic that he can pick up and put down without ever losing his place in the story.
