        Alex Carter Scenario #3
    </h2>

    <h2>Resource Tradeoffs and Tactical Choices in a Grounded Fantasy</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
Alex prefers grounded, low-fantasy stories where choices have practical consequences. He starts a new run and quickly encounters a survival-style decision: spend scarce rations now for a short-term benefit, or conserve resources and accept a harder path later.
      <br><br>
Alex chooses to spend resources to gain an advantage in an upcoming encounter. Later, when supplies are limited, the game changes what options are available and makes the consequence clear. He also makes directional or tactical choices, such as deciding how to approach a dangerous situation or assigning roles in a confrontation. If his choices lead to failure, he wants that failure to feel fair, and he wants to be able to recover through checkpoints without losing the entire run.
      <br><br>
The problem Alex wants to avoid is a story where resource choices are cosmetic and outcomes feel guaranteed. To support his objective, the game needs systems that track resources, apply consequences consistently, and allow players to learn through replay rather than punishment through full restarts. A good approach is lightweight resource tracking paired with meaningful tradeoffs and checkpoint-based recovery.
