        Alex Carter Scenario #2
    </h2>

    <h2>Relationship-driven Branching to Unlock Outcomes</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
Alex enjoys replaying CYOA games to see how different choices shape relationships and unlock different scenes. He starts a new run because he wants to reach a specific outcome he missed previously. He loads the story on his phone and pays attention to how characters respond to him.
      <br><br>
During the run, Alex makes dialogue and action choices that build trust with one character while risking conflict with another. Later, when he needs help in a critical moment, an NPC’s response changes because of the relationship built across multiple scenes. This reinforces Alex’s expectation that outcomes should depend on the combination of decisions he has made throughout the story, not only the most recent choice.
      <br><br>
The main problem Alex encounters in weaker CYOA games is “fake branching,” where relationships do not meaningfully change the story and most choices funnel toward the same endings. To reach his objective, Alex needs relationship tracking that is visible, consequences that are consistent, and branching paths that reflect cumulative decisions. A good approach is a relationship system that influences available options, unlocks or blocks scenes, and supports replay by making it clear what changed and why.
