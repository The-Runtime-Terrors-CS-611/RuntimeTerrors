        Julia Finn Scenario #1
    </h2>

    <h2>Taking Breaks and Losing Progress</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
After a long, stressful day teaching 5th grade, Julia Finn, age 23, is excited to lie down in bed and play a game on her phone. She is looking for something that is fun and interesting, but that engages her brain more than most mindless mobile games. 
      <br><br>
She decides to play Forged in Fire, and plays for about an hour before she puts it away for the evening. The following day, she is excited to pick up where she left off on her adventure. When she opens the game back up, however, the game starts from a much earlier point in the game than where she ended, erasing about 30 minutes of progress. 
      <br><br>
Frustrated that she has to repeat so much of the game, she attempts to rush through and choose the same options that she chose the previous evening, but she can’t remember all of the choices she had made, and realizes that the storyline is beginning to differ from the night before. The issue with CYOA games like this is if they aren’t saving your progress after every choice, the user may not remember which choices they made previously, and won’t be able to continue the story as it was progressing the last time they played.
