        Chris Soard Scenario #1
    </h2>

    <h2>Keeping Track of Worldbuilding</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Chris is sitting down for a session of Forged in Fire after a long day of grueling work in the hot summer sun.  He picks up right where he left off, deciding whether to ambush a pack of seemingly harmless merchants traveling on the road.  While hiding in the shadows, he overhears one of them talking about their recent business ventures, and they mention the company they work for.  This jogs Chris’s memory, as he is sure the name has been mentioned before in the game.       
      <br><br>
      Since the last chance he got to play was a few days ago, Chris doesn’t quite remember the circumstances surrounding the merchant company.  He tries to rack his brain about what he has learned.  Attacking a merchant and stealing from a huge company could prove a fatal mistake later in the game.  On the other hand, if it was just a small company that he saw a flyer of in passing, then there would probably be small to no repercussions.  
      <br><br>
      He uses the in-game journal log to reference the merchant company.  This log keeps track of all worldbuilding lore that the character has learned in the game, including characters met, places visited, important events, etc.  Therefore, no matter how long between playing sessions, he is able to coherently keep track of the story and the world building.
