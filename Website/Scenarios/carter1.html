        Alex Carter Scenario #1
    </h2>

    <h2>Deployed Offline Play with Frequent Interruptions</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
While deployed, Alex has downtime but limited or unreliable connectivity. He wants to play the game on his phone in short bursts, often stopping suddenly when he is interrupted. He uses the downloadable version and starts from a saved branch.
      <br><br>
Halfway through a tense sequence, Alex has to step away immediately. When he returns later, he expects the game to restore his place or return him to a recent checkpoint so he does not lose meaningful progress. As he continues, he reaches the end of a branch that results from earlier choices. He wants the game to let him explore a different option without forcing a full restart of the entire story.
      <br><br>
The problem with many branching games in this environment is that progress is fragile: if the game requires an internet connection, or if the only save point is at the start of the story, short sessions become frustrating. To support Alex’s objective, the system must work offline, allow saving at appropriate checkpoints, and make branch endings feel like conclusions rather than hard failures. The preferred approach is offline-first play with local saves and “return to branch point” behavior when a branch ends.
