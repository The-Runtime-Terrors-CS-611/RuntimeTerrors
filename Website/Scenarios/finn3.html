        Julia Finn Scenario #3
    </h2>

    <h2>Rushed Choices</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
After a long day of teaching 5th grade, Julia Finn, age 23, settles into bed and opens Forged in Fire on her phone. She’s looking forward to unwinding with a story-driven experience that feels like reading a book, but with the added excitement of making meaningful choices.
      <br><br>
As she plays, Julia becomes immersed in the world and enjoys experimenting with different dialogue and crafting options. However, she soon notices that many of the choices feel rushed. The game often presents important decisions immediately after long blocks of text, giving her little time to process the story before selecting an option.
      <br><br>
Later that evening, Julia makes a choice she didn’t fully understand and the story takes a darker turn than she expected. She wishes she could pause, reread recent sections, or reflect on her options before committing to a decision. Instead, the game moves forward without offering a way to review or undo her choice.
      <br><br>
The issue with CYOA games like this is that when players aren’t given enough time or tools to reflect on their decisions, the experience can feel stressful rather than relaxing. For users like Julia, who value thoughtful storytelling and play these games to wind down, a lack of pacing and reflection tools can reduce enjoyment and immersion.
