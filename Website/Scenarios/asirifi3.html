        Kofi Asirifi Scenario #3
    </h2>

    <h2>The Saturday Morning "Kid-Zone" Sprint</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
During a rare 20-minute train ride to a client meeting, Kofi dives into a tense negotiation scene. The narrative tension is high, but the game’s rhythm is off; it piles on emotional stakes without giving him a second to breathe or process the consequences. He reaches a branching path where he must decide the fate of a captured spy. He wants to weigh the pros and cons, but the game forces an immediate selection. He taps the screen just as the train jolts, selecting an "aggressive" stance he didn't intend. Without an undo feature or a way to review the dialogue history, he is forced to watch a character he liked get executed. Instead of feeling like a master of his own story, he feels like a victim of the game's poor interface, leaving him frustrated for the rest of his work day. </p>
